# Kontax-Cam-Website

This is the website for Kontax Cam. Built with React (GatsbyJS and TailwindCSS). 
This is an overkill for a simple landing page, but I just liked to experiment with it as a way
for me to practice too. So a win-win situation!

## Install
1. Clone the repo
2. open terminal and head to the directory
3. run `gatsby develop` to develop and run it on localhost
