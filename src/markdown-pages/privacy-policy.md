# Privacy Policy
Last modified: **15 August 2020**


### General
Your privacy is important to Kontax Cam ('me', 'we', 'us', 'our'). If you have any questions or concerns, please contact me at [kevinlaminto.dev@gmail.com](mailto:kevinlaminto.dev@gmail.com).

TL:DR:
- I collect NO personal information. I do not know who uses or own Kontax Cam. I do however, know how many people are using the app, which devices, and which screens they visit.
This is necessary for debugging erros/crash that might happen.

### Permission we required
Kontax Cam only needs access to your camera library to save photo. Nothing more, nothing less. That's it. We also require access to your camera in order to capture photo.

### Information we collect
Kontax Cam collects basic analytics information such as the number of users, the devices they used for Kontax Cam, and which screens they visit the most.

### How we collect the information
Just like any other platforms, we collect your information from Apple, via the app store.

### How we use your information
By having your informations, we can further improve the app based on the analytics. We can also fix any bugs or issue by looking at the analytics.
